## How to use:
### Searching for servers
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854ccdbd-a577-4267-a7e4-a83019a8dc1d)<br />
Let's say we want to <b>find cracked servers</b> with at least 2 players online. Because of this I am setting <b>"Cracked" to "Yes" and "Online Players" to "At least 2"</b>   <br />
The mod searches servers automatically for your current Minecraft version.   <br />

After clicking on "Find", we can now just <b>add all servers</b>  <br />

And just that easy, the servers are now in your server list!   <br />

### Searching for players
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bfc1700-f6e2-4fc3-9982-d6bef77a3fe0) <br />
Let's say we want to find the player with the name <b>"Ogmur"</b>. We just type "Ogmur" into the box, and click on <b>"Find Player"</b>   <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cacfa8bb-6cda-4f9b-8ceb-2d5675016a3e) <br />
Now we can just add the servers we want, or <b>even add all!</b>   <br />

### Getting players on a server
Simply select a server and click on <b>"Get players"</b>!   <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1224583b-a4e5-439c-b950-a2445504a627) <br />
You can now see the player history. Clicking on <b>"Login"</b> will log you into the account in cracked mode.    <br />
